# Feature Idea Capture

User is mid-development and thought of a feature idea. Capture it fast so they can keep working.

## Your Goal

Add the feature to `docs/roadmap/icebox.md` under the appropriate category.

## How to Get There

**Ask brief questions** to fill gaps - respect the user's time. Usually need:
- What's the feature in 1-2 sentences
- Which category it fits (or closest match)

**Skip what's obvious** - If category is clear from description, don't ask.

**Keep it fast** - Total exchange under 1 minute. Get what you need, append to icebox, done.

## Categories

- Study Sessions & Gamification
- Social Features
- Card Creation & Import
- Rich Content Support
- Card Quality & AI
- Organization & Deck Management
- Spaced Repetition Settings
- Platform Expansion
- Infrastructure & Observability

## Format

Append to the appropriate category section in icebox.md:

```markdown
- [Feature Name](features/feature-name.md) - Brief description if helpful
```

If the idea is simple enough, just add the line item without creating a separate file. If it needs more detail, create `docs/roadmap/features/feature-name.md` with a brief description.

## Behavior Rules

- Be conversational - ask what makes sense, not a checklist
- Max 2-3 questions
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Don't over-engineer the description
